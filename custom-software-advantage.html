      <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
      <p>
        Many businesses start off using off-the-shelf software — and for basic
        tasks, it works. But as your operations grow more complex, pre-built
        solutions start to show their limits. That’s where custom software gives
        you the edge.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 1 -->
      <h2>Built for Your Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        Generic tools force your business to adapt to their structure. Custom
        software is built around your actual workflow, saving time and improving
        efficiency. From inventory systems to CRMs, the difference is real.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 2 -->
      <h2>More Control and Flexibility</h2>
      <p>
        With custom solutions, you decide the features, logic, and integrations
        — and you're not at the mercy of third-party update cycles or licensing
        rules. That control translates to stability and growth.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 3 -->
      <h2>Better Data & Decision Making</h2>
      <p>
        Custom systems can capture and analyze exactly the data you need.
        Whether it's tracking customer behavior or optimizing delivery routes,
        you get insights aligned to your business goals.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 4 -->
      <h2>Security & Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Tailored systems let you implement specific security measures and data
        policies that match your industry requirements. No bloatware, fewer
        vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 5 -->
      <h2>Investing in Growth</h2>
      <p>
        While custom software has an upfront cost, it pays back in saved time,
        reduced errors, and a better customer experience. It grows with your
        business — not against it.
      </p>

      <!-- Point 6 -->
      <h2>Our Role</h2>
      <p>
        Sophon Tech designs and develops custom software for Kenyan businesses
        ready to scale. From discovery to deployment, we build solutions that
        work — and last.
