      <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
      <p>
        As businesses adopt more digital tools and cloud services, the risks to
        their IT systems continue to grow. At Sophon Tech, we see too many
        businesses — especially small and mid-sized ones — making critical
        security errors that expose them to data loss, breaches, and
        reputational harm.
      </p>

      <!-- Tip 1 -->
      <h2>1. Weak or Reused Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        Using the same password across multiple systems is one of the biggest
        security risks. In 2025, password attacks are becoming more automated
        and aggressive. Always enforce strong password policies and encourage
        the use of password managers and two-factor authentication (2FA).
      </p>

      <!-- Tip 2 -->
      <h2>2. Ignoring Software Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Outdated software, operating systems, and plugins are prime targets for
        attackers. Regular updates and patch management should be part of your
        IT routine — not an afterthought.
      </p>

      <!-- Tip 3 -->
      <h2>3. No Employee Cybersecurity Training</h2>
      <p>
        Most breaches start with human error. Train your team to spot phishing
        emails, use secure connections, and follow your company’s data policies.
        Security is everyone's job.
      </p>

      <!-- Tip 4 -->
      <h2>4. Poor Backup Practices</h2>
      <p>
        If ransomware hits your system and you don’t have a clean, recent
        backup, your options become very limited. Set up regular, automatic,
        encrypted backups — and test them often.
      </p>

      <!-- Tip 5 -->
      <h2>5. Assuming “It Won’t Happen to Us”</h2>
      <p>
        Cyber attacks target small businesses too. In fact, they often lack the
        protections that larger organizations have. Don’t wait for an incident
        to start thinking about your cybersecurity posture.
      </p>

      <!-- Final Takeaway -->
      <h2>Final Advice</h2>
      <p>
        A strong IT security foundation doesn’t need to be expensive — just
        intentional. At Sophon Tech, we help businesses assess vulnerabilities,
        set up security frameworks, and stay protected.
