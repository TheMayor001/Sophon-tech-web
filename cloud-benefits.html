  <section>
    <p>
      In today's competitive landscape, businesses — especially in Kenya — are turning to cloud computing to reduce operational costs, increase scalability, and enhance agility. The cloud has become a powerful enabler for startups and SMEs that previously lacked access to enterprise-grade infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Cloud Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional IT infrastructure is expensive to maintain and difficult to scale. Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer a pay-as-you-go model, allowing companies to scale up (or down) as needed without massive upfront costs.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits You Can Expect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Only pay for what you use.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Add or reduce resources as your needs change.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Cloud providers offer advanced tools and encryption.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Anywhere:</strong> Work remotely and collaborate in real-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> Your data is safe and backed up offsite.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Success Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Sophon Tech recently helped a Nairobi-based logistics startup migrate to the cloud, improving their application speed by 60% and reducing monthly IT costs by nearly half. These kinds of results are now possible for businesses across Kenya and East Africa.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Embracing cloud technology is no longer optional — it’s a competitive advantage. At Sophon Tech, we guide you through every step of the transformation with strategy, training, and ongoing support.
